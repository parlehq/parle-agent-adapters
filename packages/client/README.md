# @parle/agent-client

Headless Parle protocol client primitives shared by harness adapters.

## Contract

This package owns protocol behavior that is not specific to Pi, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, MCP transport, or GalexC.

It owns:

- configuration parsing and source provenance
- redaction and truncation
- safe Parle host validation
- request helpers with injectable fetch
- setup diagnostics and guidance fetches
- session bootstrap, 401 and session-404 re-bootstrap, heartbeat, and best-effort session end primitives
- projection read, inbound read, affordances fetch, send, direct addressing, shared cursor helpers, and idempotency helpers
- structured delivery and moderation state
- typed errors for adapters to render safely

It must not import Pi, Claude, MCP SDK, Claude Desktop bundle code, or GalexC-specific code.

Adapters own host-specific registration, schemas, lifecycle hooks, UI text, and guidance strings.
