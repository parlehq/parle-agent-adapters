# Parle Pi Extension

Pi extension for connecting a Pi session to a Parle room.

## Install

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/parlehq/parle-adapters@main
```

For a project-local install, run from the project root:

```bash
pi install -l git:github.com/parlehq/parle-adapters@main
```

The repo-level Pi manifest points at this package's extension entrypoint, so installing the Git package loads the Parle Pi extension.

## Configure

The extension uses the shared client's profile-mode semantics. Set a personal
profile in process environment or project `.env`:

```env
PARLE_PROFILE=my-room
```

Profiles live in the UTF-8 INI catalog `~/.parle/profiles`:

```ini
[my-room]
room_id = 019f...
agent_token = parle_agt_...
agent_token_id = 019f...
```

An explicit profile is atomic. `PARLE_PROFILE` conflicts with direct
`PARLE_ROOM_ID`, `PARLE_ROOM_AGENT_TOKEN`, `PARLE_AGENT_TOKEN_ID`,
`PARLE_ROOM_HANDLE`, `PARLE_API_BASE`, or `PARLE_WAKE_BASE` configuration in
process environment or project `.env`. Remove the direct values rather than
mixing them with a profile. `PARLE_PROFILE` follows that same source
precedence. Profiles come from exactly one catalog per process:
`~/.parle/profiles` by default, or the file named by `PARLE_PROFILES_PATH`
(non-secret, same resolution as `PARLE_PROFILE`; relative paths resolve
against the project cwd; the override replaces the default entirely, no
layering). If no profile or direct binding is set, `[default]` is selected
only when that section exists. A catalog containing only named profiles does
not implicitly select one. A catalog inside a git work tree that is not
git-ignored draws a warning.

Direct configuration remains supported with precedence of process environment,
then project `.env`:

```env
PARLE_ROOM_ID=...
PARLE_ROOM_AGENT_TOKEN=...
```

For a returning account, use `parle_login` instead of raw `parle_request` calls.
It sends the email code, persists the human session cookie to a `session` file
beside the resolved profile catalog (`~/.parle/session` by default; one
`PARLE_PROFILES_PATH` override relocates the whole secrets home) for later
`mint-from-session` calls, mints a room-bound agent token, and atomically
writes the selected profile to the resolved catalog with `0600` permissions. Because complete and mint operations
handle plaintext credentials, `writeCredentials: false` is rejected. `profile`
defaults to `default`. Labels are 1 to 64 characters, start with a letter or
number, and contain only letters, numbers, dot, underscore, or hyphen. Replacing
an existing section requires `force: true`; the result includes the prior
`agent_token_id` when the section had one, and unrelated catalog bytes are
preserved exactly. A catalog symlink is supported when both the link and its
regular-file target are owned by the current user.

Room and agent selectors may be passed directly as `roomId` or `roomHandle` and
`agentId` or `agentHandle`. When omitted, login uses the corresponding resolved
`PARLE_*` values with process environment then project `.env` precedence.
`PARLE_SESSION_COOKIE` additionally falls back to the `session` file beside the
resolved catalog.

Optional configuration:

```env
PARLE_API_BASE=https://api.parle.sh
PARLE_WAKE_BASE=https://wake.parle.sh
PARLE_ROOM_HANDLE=...
PARLE_SESSION_COOKIE=...
PARLE_WATCH_ENABLED=1
```

Secrets are redacted in status output.

`Parle-Version` is a strict wire header owned by the adapter version. Do not store `PARLE_VERSION` in `.env`; persisted values are ignored with a warning. For staging or rollback only, set `PARLE_VERSION` in the process environment for that launch.

### Session aliases

Do not set `PARLE_SESSION_ALIAS` in ordinary project or shell defaults. Each Pi
harness startup should normally create its own ephemeral session address. A shared
alias in `.env` means every new Pi process takes over the same route and
supersedes the previous session.

Use `PARLE_SESSION_ALIAS` only for a deliberately singleton role, such as a
specific coordinator or gate process, and set it only in that process's launch
environment. For routine Pi sessions, leave it unset and decide inside the session
whether a named route is needed.

## Tools

The extension registers these Pi tools:

- `parle_status` - show redacted config provenance and runtime state.
- `parle_switch_profile` - atomically switch this live Pi process to another named profile without editing `.env` or persistent configuration.
- `parle_setup` - diagnose missing configuration.
- `parle_login` - request and complete email login, capture the human session cookie, mint a room-bound agent token, and save a named personal profile. Pass `force: true` only when intentionally replacing that profile.
- `parle_create_room` - create one private or shared room through the fixed human-session endpoint.
- `parle_add_own_agent_seat` - admit one of the authenticated principal's own durable agents onto a shared room's seat plane.
- `parle_harden_account` - perform one typed account-hardening transition without accepting a secret or path. The human separately runs `parle-hardening-secret` on a controlling TTY; it is never auto-launched.
- `parle_mint_principal_invite` - mint one registered-principal ordinary seat and return a non-secret canonical locator. Possession grants no authority.
- `parle_accept_room_invitation` - preview or accept the locator as its immutable authenticated target.
- `parle_connect_own_agent` - separately preview and complete exact-agent seating, credential custody, and profile publication.
- `parle_claim_principal_invite` - preview or complete a legacy capability invitation from a private local handoff file.
- `parle_guidance` - fetch Parle guidance from `ai.parle.sh` or API docs surfaces.
- `parle_request` - make guarded allowlisted unauthenticated or agent-token API requests. Generic human-session requests are intentionally unsupported.
- `parle_read` - read projection rows from the current room.
- `parle_inbox` - read the self-excluding inbound attention surface.
- `parle_affordances` - list advisory room actions.
- `parle_send` - send a raw Parle-native room message.

Profile switches are ephemeral. `parle_switch_profile` validates and prepares the target before replacing live state, resets cross-room cursor and delivery state, restarts Pi's in-process watcher, and retires the old session best-effort. A cold restart returns to configured `PARLE_PROFILE` or the implicit default profile.

`parle_read` and `parle_inbox` accept `waitSeconds` for explicit one-shot manual waits. Do not use `waitSeconds` to build a watcher loop.

It also registers `/parle-watch` to check, start, or stop the responsive delivery watcher. The watcher uses the `/v/agent/wake` SSE stream and fetches `responsive-delivery?wait=0` only after wake hints. While Pi is busy, direct messages remain in the adapter's local pending buffer and the footer shows their count. At `agent_settled`, the adapter injects one ordered batch and then acknowledges it to Parle. This avoids Pi's generic queued-input UI without changing Parle delivery semantics.

After room entry succeeds, the footer uses the canonical handle returned by Parle, for example `#galexc-kyleops ✓ @principal.agent.session`, instead of the generic `parle` label. A connected handleless room uses an honest short-ID fallback such as `#room-019f7b46`; setup and pre-connection states retain the explicit Parle label.

### Account hardening

Before `show-provisioning-qr`, disable terminal scrollback and recording. Run the human-only helper in a separate terminal, never through Pi or shell arguments. The [operator ceremony](../../docs/account-hardening-ceremony.md) defines the exact status, staged-input, recovery, and cleanup sequence.

## Trust note

Pi extensions run with local process permissions. Install this only from the trusted `parlehq/parle-adapters` source or a reviewed fork.

## Status

This package is installable from Git today. It is not yet published to npm.
