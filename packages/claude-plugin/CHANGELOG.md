# Changelog

## 0.4.0 (2026-07-07)

Invisible session UX: eager bootstrap, `parle_status` auto-connect, and a statusline surface (MCP tool contract change; bundled artifact refresh).

- The MCP server now bootstraps the room agent session eagerly in the background at startup when `PARLE_ROOM_ID` and `PARLE_ROOM_AGENT_TOKEN` are configured. Bootstrap is single-flight: eager startup, a racing first tool call, and 401 rebootstrap converge on one in-flight session mint. Failures record `bootstrapState: "failed"` with `lastBootstrapError` and `nextRetryAt` (exponential backoff, 5s doubling to 60s cap) instead of caching failure until restart.
- BREAKING-ish: `parle_status` is no longer a passive read by default. When configured and not yet connected it auto-connects first (joining any in-flight bootstrap, respecting the failure backoff window) and reports `bootstrapAttempted`. Pass `inspect: true` for the old no-network behavior. Annotations changed from `readOnlyHint` to `destructiveHint: false, idempotentHint: true, openWorldHint: true`; permission allowlists keyed on read-only semantics should be reviewed. Explicit calls (`parle_connect`, reads, sends) are unchanged and always retry.
- The MCP server publishes a display-safe per-process runtime snapshot to `<cwd>/.parle/runtime/<pid>.json` (directory 0700, file 0600, atomic rename): state, session address, agent session id, room, expiry, adapter. Never a credential. Files self-invalidate via expiry plus pid liveness; provably stale sibling files are pruned at startup; the file is removed on shutdown and the session is ended best-effort on SIGINT/SIGTERM. Add `.parle/runtime/` to `.gitignore` alongside `.parle/credentials`.
- New `statusline/parle-statusline.mjs` helper: a self-contained, read-only Claude Code statusline segment. Exactly one live session in the cwd shows `parle ✓ @principal.agent.session`; multiple live sessions show `parle ✓ N sessions` (never a specific address, which could belong to a sibling Claude session); configured-but-disconnected shows `parle · off`. The display is cwd-scoped, not Claude-session-authoritative. PID-reuse start-time verification is advisory and skipped where `ps` is unavailable.

## 0.3.2 (2026-07-07)

Session credential bootstrap fix plus bundled Pi login and watcher refresh.

- Agent client session bootstrap now parses the raw create-session body only for the secret `session_credential` response so `Parle-Agent-Session` receives the real `parle_ses_` credential. Surfaced errors and status output remain redacted.
- Pi extension adds `parle_login` for email-code login, session-cookie capture, local `.parle/credentials` persistence, and room-bound token minting with fail-closed local secret-sink checks.
- Pi extension starts the responsive watcher after late lazy bootstrap or login so sessions that acquire credentials after startup become reachable without a restart.

## 0.3.1 (2026-07-07)

Stale-credential diagnostics (bundled `@parlehq/agent-client` refresh). Configuration is resolved once at MCP server start with precedence process env > .env > .parle/credentials; a token rotated on disk afterwards cannot take effect until the host process restarts. Previously that failure surfaced as a bare `Parle API 401` with no remediation path.

- 401 errors now append a hint when PARLE_ROOM_AGENT_TOKEN on disk (.env or .parle/credentials, in precedence order) differs from the value the process loaded at startup: the token was likely rotated and the host process needs a restart.
- `parle_setup` reports `ok: false` with a `warning` when the loaded token diverges from disk (previously a stale token passed as `ok: true`), and `parle_status` includes the same warning in `warnings`.
- The Pi extension pushes an equivalent warning into its config warnings when the process env snapshot shadows a different on-disk token.
- SKILL and README now document source precedence, the read-once snapshot semantics, and the rotation procedure.

## 0.3.0 (2026-07-07)

Wire protocol hard cut (parlehq/parle #436/#437; bundled artifact refresh; behavior shipped in adapters commit 207c8cc without a version bump - this release corrects that):

- Parle-Version 2026-07-07 required; the prior version string is rejected by the server. Sessions created before the cutover are invalid; reconnect with parle_connect.
- Session selection now uses the secret parle_ses_ session credential returned at session create. Display handles and aliases never authenticate.
- Optional PARLE_SESSION_ALIAS claims a durable named route, for example @principal.agent.gate-reviewer, with last-claim-wins supersession and generation fencing. Leave it unset for ordinary sessions and parallel workers.
- parle_ses_ added to redaction (redactString and sensitive-value detection).
- Note: if PARLE_VERSION is pinned in your environment it overrides the artifact default; update or unset it to 2026-07-07 semantics.

## 0.2.0 (2026-07-07)

MCP tool contract change (bundled `@parlehq/mcp-server` artifact refresh):

- New `parle_connect` tool: establishes or reuses the room agent session and returns a redaction-safe connection summary (session address, agent session id, participant id, expiry, cursor, held backlog). Idempotent while the session is live.
- Reads and sends that lazily establish a session now include a `session` block identifying the session they created.
- `parle_status` exposes `agentSessionId` (room-visible operational metadata; classification tracked in parlehq/parle#48). `sessionHandle` stays redacted. Optional config values are marked `optional`.
- `parle_setup` reports connection posture (`connected`) and points at `parle_connect`.
- Skill: new Connect flow section; arming the responsive watcher is now the default part of connecting.
- Tool contract lock file added (`@parlehq/mcp-server` `tool-contract.lock.json`); contract changes now require a lock diff, version decision, and changelog note.

Upstream API-first counterparts: parlehq/parle#47 (document session bootstrap in discovery surfaces), #48 (classify agent_session_id), #49 (session lifecycle and delivery baseline contract).
