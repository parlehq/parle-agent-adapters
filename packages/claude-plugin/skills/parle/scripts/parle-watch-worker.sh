# parle-watch.sh -- exit 0 when relevant room activity lands past SINCE_SEQ.
#
# Run in the background from a Claude Code session; the exit re-wakes the
# session, which then drains parle_inbox and restarts the watch. One held
# long-poll connection, no tight loops.
#
# Usage: parle-watch.sh <since_seq> [my_agent_session_id]
#
# With my_agent_session_id set, rows you authored and directs addressed to
# other sessions are skipped instead of waking you, so busy multi-session
# rooms stay quiet and the own-send restart caveat disappears. Your id is
# the addressing.target_agent_session_id on any direct you received, or
# author.agent_session_id on rows you authored in parle_read. Without it,
# any new room row wakes you (v1 behavior).
#
# Session liveness: the projection poll authenticates with the room agent
# token plus a dedicated watcher-session credential owned by the Node launcher.
# That credential is distinct from the primary session this script filters on,
# so the server still cannot tell this script that the filtered session has
# died (host reload, session end). When my_agent_session_id
# is set, each cycle also checks the local .parle/runtime/*.json snapshots
# the adapters publish. Own-snapshot evidence is classified before absence
# counts for anything: a snapshot carrying this id that is expired (or within
# the 30s guard band) or whose writer pid is dead or verifiably recycled
# (process start time mismatches processStartedAt, checked via /proc then
# ps etime where available) is AFFIRMATIVE evidence the session is gone and
# exits 3 regardless of history; one that is present but not ready (bootstrap
# retry or failure in progress) holds as inconclusive.
# Plain absence is era-gated: only after this watch has itself seen the
# session live in a snapshot does present-then-absent (for two consecutive
# checks) exit 3. A session id that was NEVER present is inconclusive -- host
# predating snapshot publishing, another cwd, or a missing file for a live
# server (observed in the field, adapters#22) -- so the watch notes it once
# on stderr and keeps holding. No snapshots at all is likewise indeterminate
# (direct-HTTP sessions publish none). Every exit 3 is preceded by a
# redaction-safe per-file forensics dump on stderr so a disputed verdict is
# arguable from evidence. Set PARLE_WATCH_SESSION_LIVENESS=0 to disable the
# check entirely.
#
# Needs: PARLE_API_BASE, PARLE_ROOM_ID, PARLE_ROOM_AGENT_TOKEN
# Exit:  0 = relevant activity past since_seq, 2 = terminal or repeated
#        failures, 3 = my_agent_session_id is gone from this host (reconnect
#        with parle_connect and arm a fresh watch; do not re-arm with the old
#        id or watermark). An exit 3 near the session's scheduled expiresAt
#        is expected pre-expiry rollover, not a heuristic failure. If
#        parle_connect says the same session is alive, check the remaining
#        TTL: seconds to spare confirms the rollover; plenty of TTL means a
#        false verdict -- re-arm with PARLE_WATCH_SESSION_LIVENESS=0
#
# The public parle-watch.sh entrypoint always launches this private worker
# through the bundled Node resolver. It applies the shared client precedence
# and profile semantics on every arm, then supplies the resolved binding only
# through this child's environment. Do not invoke this worker directly.
