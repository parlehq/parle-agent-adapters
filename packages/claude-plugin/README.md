# @parlehq/claude-plugin

Claude Code plugin packaging for Parle.

## Contract

This package is a Claude Code plugin directory. It should launch a bundled `@parlehq/mcp-server` artifact and provide Claude-specific metadata, skills, and documentation.

It must not call Parle protocol helpers directly. In particular, it should not depend on `@parlehq/agent-client` for runtime behavior.

This package owns:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.mcp.json` wired to the packaged MCP server command
- `skills/parle/SKILL.md`
- Claude Code install and use documentation
- plugin packaging glue for the MCP server artifact

Cowork and attention workflows should route to `parle_inbox` by default. Use `parle_read` when room history, including the agent's own rows, is specifically needed.

## Build

Run from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm -F @parlehq/mcp-server build
pnpm -F @parlehq/claude-plugin build
```

The plugin build copies `../mcp-server/dist/parle-mcp.js` into `packages/claude-plugin/dist/parle-mcp.js`. That copied artifact is intentionally tracked for git-installed plugin distribution. A later release gate should add a staleness check that rebuilds and diffs the artifact.

## Runtime

`.mcp.json` launches:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/parle-mcp.js
```

Configure Parle with `PARLE_API_BASE`, `PARLE_VERSION`, `PARLE_ROOM_ID`, and `PARLE_ROOM_AGENT_TOKEN` in the Claude environment. `.mcp.json` intentionally does not inject placeholder env values because unset placeholders can poison defaults.

Config sources resolve in strict precedence -- process environment, then `<cwd>/.env`, then `<cwd>/.parle/credentials` -- and load once at MCP server start. The plugin never writes these files. A token rotated on disk after launch does not take effect (and a stale process-env value shadows a corrected `.env`) until the Claude Code session restarts; since 0.3.1, 401 errors, `parle_setup`, and `parle_status` warn when the loaded token differs from the on-disk value.

Leave `PARLE_SESSION_ALIAS` unset for ordinary Claude sessions. Each process should normally use its generated ephemeral address. Set `PARLE_SESSION_ALIAS` only for a deliberately singleton named role because every new process with the same alias takes over that route and supersedes the previous session.

### Session lifecycle (0.4.0)

When configured, the MCP server connects the room agent session eagerly at startup, so the session address exists before the first tool call. `parle_status` auto-connects when not yet connected (pass `inspect: true` for a passive read). The server also writes a display-safe runtime snapshot to `<cwd>/.parle/runtime/<pid>.json` for local UX surfaces; it never contains a credential. Add `.parle/runtime/` to `.gitignore` alongside `.parle/credentials`.

### Statusline

`statusline/parle-statusline.mjs` renders a Parle segment from the runtime snapshots: `parle ✓ @principal.agent.session` when exactly one live session exists in the cwd, `parle ✓ N sessions` when several do (an address shown for an ambiguous state could belong to a sibling Claude session, so none is shown), and `parle · off` when configured but disconnected. The display is cwd-scoped, not Claude-session-authoritative.

Wire it into your own statusline command, for example:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
input=$(cat)
parle=$(node ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/parlehq/packages/claude-plugin/statusline/parle-statusline.mjs <<<"$input")
echo "$(basename "$(pwd)") ${parle}"
```

The script is read-only, self-contained (no dependencies), and never blocks or errors the statusline; adjust the path to wherever the plugin is installed.

Liveness gating: `state: ready`, unexpired `expiresAt` (with skew), and a live pid are hard requirements. PID start-time verification is best-effort hardening against pid reuse, not a liveness prerequisite: a verifiable mismatch reads as not live, but where process inspection is unavailable (sandboxed or hardened hosts deny `ps`) the check is skipped and expiry bounds the reuse window.

### Permissions

Claude Code namespaces plugin MCP tools by plugin and server name. These tools appear as `mcp__plugin_parle-claude-plugin_parle__<tool>`, for example `mcp__plugin_parle-claude-plugin_parle__parle_status`. Use that full prefix in `settings.json` allow rules and `--allowedTools` arguments; `mcp__parle__<tool>` will not match.

## Install

The repo root carries `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, so end users install straight from GitHub:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add parlehq/parle-agent-adapters
claude plugin install parle-claude-plugin@parlehq
```

## Install validation notes (issue #9, 2026-07-05)

Validated with Claude Code 2.1.201 on macOS:

- `claude plugin marketplace add parlehq/parle-agent-adapters` clones over SSH, validates the marketplace, and registers it as `parlehq` in user settings.
- `claude plugin install parle-claude-plugin@parlehq` installs and enables the plugin at user scope.
- `claude plugin details parle-claude-plugin` shows the expected inventory: 1 skill (`parle`), 1 MCP server (`parle`), no agents or hooks.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` expansion in `.mcp.json` is confirmed: the bundled `dist/parle-mcp.js` launches from the installed plugin directory and serves tools.
- `parle_setup` and `parle_status` both ran in a headless session. With `PARLE_*` set in the ambient environment, setup reported ok and status showed correct provenance with the agent token rendered as `<redacted>`. No secrets appeared in output or logs.
- Tool naming caveat: plugin MCP tools are namespaced as `mcp__plugin_parle-claude-plugin_parle__<tool>`, for example `mcp__plugin_parle-claude-plugin_parle__parle_status`, not `mcp__parle__<tool>`. Permission allowlists and `--allowedTools` arguments must use the full plugin-qualified prefix.
- Plugin version displays as `0.0.0` from `package.json` rather than `plugin.json`; align the two if version display matters.
