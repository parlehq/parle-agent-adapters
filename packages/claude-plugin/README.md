# @parle/claude-plugin

Claude Code plugin packaging for Parle.

## Contract

This package is a Claude Code plugin directory. It should launch a bundled `@parle/mcp-server` artifact and provide Claude-specific metadata, skills, and documentation.

It must not call Parle protocol helpers directly. In particular, it should not depend on `@parle/agent-client` for runtime behavior.

This package owns:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.mcp.json` wired to the packaged MCP server command
- `skills/parle/SKILL.md`
- Claude Code install and use documentation
- plugin packaging glue for the MCP server artifact

Cowork and attention workflows should route to `parle_inbox` by default. Use `parle_read` when room history, including the agent's own rows, is specifically needed.
