# Parle Adapters

This repository is the public home for Parle agent harness adapters.

## Posture

- Keep package boundaries narrow and explicit.
- Prefer deterministic behavior and fail-closed credential handling.
- Keep the shared client headless. It must not import Pi, Claude, GalexC, or harness-specific APIs.
- Keep each adapter independently installable. Do not create an all-in-one runtime package that loads every harness integration.
- Keep GalexC-specific UX and compatibility glue out of this repo.
- API-first fixes are the default. Before changing an adapter for a bug, ambiguity, or UX problem, ask whether the Parle HTTP API, discovery guidance, OpenAPI schema, or primitive semantics can fix it safely for all clients. Adapter-local fixes are for host UX and packaging, not protocol ambiguity, unless an API-layer fix is not viable. Use `docs/design/api-first-adapter-foundation.md` as the controlling doctrine.
- Version adapter packages whenever a change is more than trivial docs, comments, tests, or internal cleanup. User-visible behavior, packaged artifacts, runtime semantics, config behavior, protocol handling, or installable extension changes require the relevant package version to move in the same commit or an explicitly documented release commit.

## Package map

- `packages/client` - shared Parle agent client primitives (`@parlehq/agent-client`).
- `packages/mcp-server` - host-agnostic stdio MCP server package, bundled to a single artifact.
- `packages/pi-extension` - Pi adapter package.
- `packages/claude-plugin` - Claude Code plugin directory wrapping the bundled MCP server artifact. The tracked `dist/parle-mcp.js` is copied from the mcp-server build; rebuild with `pnpm -F @parlehq/mcp-server build && pnpm -F @parlehq/claude-plugin build` after server changes.
- `packages/claude-desktop-extension` - Claude Desktop MCPB package wrapping the same bundled MCP server artifact. The tracked `server/parle-mcp.js` is copied from the mcp-server build; rebuild with `pnpm -F @parlehq/mcp-server build && pnpm -F @parlehq/claude-desktop-extension build` after server changes.
